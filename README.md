# Crime-analysis-using-D3.js-VAST-MC-2015-

The Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. The VAST Challenge is designed to help researchers understand how their software would be used in a novel analytic task and determine if their data transformations, visualizations, and interactions would be beneficial for particular analytic tasks. VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems.

In this Project we analyse the visitor movement data across a fictional theme park to identify a crime that happened at the park.

Tech stack used:
1. D3.js, HTML, CSS for front end
2. Pandas, Numpy and scikit-learn for data analysis
